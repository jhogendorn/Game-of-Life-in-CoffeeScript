# Conway's Game Of Life in CoffeeScript

## Overview

I wrote this to teach myself some coffeescript. By making a new GameOfLife object, you can use setInterval to animate over generations (see example.coffee).
It also tracks generations so you can halt your animation when it reaches a stable state, taking into account oscillating patterns.

## Dependencies

### Optional

json2.js for JSON serialization, if you want to run in older browsers that dont automatically support JSON.
